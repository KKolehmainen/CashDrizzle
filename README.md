# Cash Drizzle

Cash Drizzle is a simple and fun arcade-style video game where your goal is simple: collect falling coins while avoiding tricky enemies. 

As you play, coins will rain down from the sky in a colorful cascade. You control a robot armed with a net, and your job is to skillfully move around, swiping up coins while avoiding funny and mischievous foes. The more coins you gather, the higher your score!
